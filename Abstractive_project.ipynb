To figure that out, researchers used a CommonsenseQA dataset for BERT to solve multiple-choice problems.\n",

This dataset is known for comprising a broad set of triples, of the relation pair — source concept, relation, target concept, considering the concept is ‘Bird’, and the reaction type is ‘at location.’\n",

Attention weights are significant while producing next layer representation, but it becomes insufficient to identify the behaviour of the attention head by disregarding the value of the hidden vector. And that’s why researchers added the supplement of attribution scores to interpret the contribution of each input in backpropagation. Both of the values allowed the researchers to understand the common sense link in BERT better.\n",

Thus, to identify if BERT, a large pre-trained NLP model developed by Google, can solve common sense tasks, researchers took a closer look. However, to examine the presence of common sense in BERT, the researchers examined the common sense link between the question and the answer, which is then manually annoyed in the provided data set. With each question [q], there are five answers [a1 … a5], the researchers then linked the question with each response to obtain five concatenated sequences [s1 … s5], respectively. To facilitate the analysis, the researchers assessed the common sense links using attention weight and respective attributing score. Attention weights are significant while producing next layer representation, but it becomes insufficient to identify the behaviour of the attention head by disregarding the value of the hidden vector. And that’s why researchers added the supplement of attribution scores to interpret the contribution of each input in backpropagation.\n"
